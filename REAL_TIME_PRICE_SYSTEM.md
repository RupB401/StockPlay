## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Holdings table includes real-time price tracking
UPDATE stock_holdings 
SET current_price = real_time_price, 
    current_value = quantity * real_time_price, 
    last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE symbol = 'AAPL';
```

### Price Update Flow
1. **Scheduled Updates**: Background scheduler fetches prices every 5 minutes
2. **Portfolio Access**: Real-time updates when users view portfolio
3. **Trading Operations**: Price validation during buy/sell transactions
4. **Manual Triggers**: Admin-initiated comprehensive updates

### API Integration
- **Primary**: yfinance (multiple methods)
- **Fallback**: Yahoo Finance HTTP API
- **Support**: Stocks, ETFs, Market Indices
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays and error handling

## Usage Examples

### 1. Automatic Updates
The system runs automatically in the background:
```python
# Started on application startup
start_price_scheduler()

# Runs every 5 minutes during market hours
# Updates all holdings automatically
```

### 2. Manual Updates
```bash
# Update all holdings
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/admin/update-prices"

# Update specific symbol
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/admin/update-prices?symbol=AAPL"
```

### 3. Status Monitoring
```bash
# Check update status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/admin/price-update-status"
```

## Portfolio Calculations

### Before (Static Prices)
```
Holdings: 100 AAPL at $150 avg cost = $15,000 invested
Current Value: 100 * $150 = $15,000 (no gain/loss)
```

### After (Real-Time Prices)
```
Holdings: 100 AAPL at $150 avg cost = $15,000 invested  
Current Price: $214.80 (real-time)
Current Value: 100 * $214.80 = $21,480
Unrealized Gain: $21,480 - $15,000 = $6,480 (+43.2%)
```
